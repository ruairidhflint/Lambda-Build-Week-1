# Pintereach - User Build Week 1 - Ruairidh Flint

I was given the following brief to design the basic aesthetic site layout and landing pages:

" As a researcher, it's difficult to keep track of articles you want to read later. Pintereach helps you research by enabling you to save and organize articles in to categories to read later. "

My initial research led me to both Pocket, Evernote and Pinterest, all somewwhat simular products. Using
the former two sites as inspiration for my basic design I set about to achieve the following goals:

* Create an aestheticly pleasing and modern desktop site for Pintereach.
* The site must be responsive and have an excellent mobile version.
* Multiple attractive pages including a log in form and a sign up form.

My stretch goals would be:

* To implement Javascript in such a way that content is injected from a data set
* Some sort of Javascript affecting the log in form
* Fully responsive at all sizes. 


## Technologies Used 

1.) HTML5 was used as the primary structure.
2.) CSS3 was used for the main styling.
3.) LESS was used to write the styling which was then compiled to CSS.
4.) Javascript was used for various functionality.
